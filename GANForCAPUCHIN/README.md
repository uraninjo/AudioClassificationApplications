# GANForCAPUCHIN

In this model, I have tried to train my model to create the sounds of Capuchin Birds.

I converted Capuchin Bird sounds to waveforms and waveforms to a spectrogram. In that way, I can train my model with CNN. I thought I can get better results by doing it.Then I used these photos to train GAN.

For training, batch_size should be reconsidered for GPUs. Could have been increased or decreased.
